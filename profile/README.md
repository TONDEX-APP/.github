### The TONDEX platform provides on-chain analytics, a swap tool, and DEXs, there is a lot to process for any level trader.

Put simply, TONDEX offers data. We work hard to gather all relevant on-chain data to then present it to TONDEX users in a helpful and efficient way for DeFi traders. Data will be collected from TVM compatible chains so DeFi traders on TON  can enjoy the same trading experience when analyzing their favourite Jettons. This will be done by monitoring many unique DEXs and their pools for liquidity changes, trades, and price movements.

To complete the all-in-one trading experience, TONDEX also offers a swap tool. The swap tool allows users to buy and sell spot assets directly from the TONDEX terminal without using a separate protocol. Transactions are collected and processed by the API, offering the best exchange rates for your trades.

Using the foundations of on-chain data, the TONDEX team continues to find more efficient and effective ways of presenting this data. The multi-chart trading tool, your favourite Jettons tab, and your wallet breakdown compile on-chain activity to help you, the trader.

There are thousands of Jettons in the market, and market participants must work hard to evaluate and design a sophisticated crypto strategy to get the best out of them. TONDEX aggregator make this task easier by consolidating the research that a trader has to do in either real-time or otherwise. This saves a lot of time and effort for the user.

### Anti-Rug AI
The AI anti-rug bot is a tool currently in development by 0x0 to help protect users from scams in the DeFi space. It works by using advanced algorithms to analyze transactions and detect suspicious behavior, such as setting a tax too high or removing liquidity. If the bot detects any suspicious behavior, it will automatically frontrun the transaction, preventing users from getting rug pulled.
One of the main benefits of the AI anti-scam bot is that it provides an added layer of security for users in the DeFi space. Scams and frauds are unfortunately common in the DeFi space, and can result in significant financial losses for users. By using the anti-scam bot, users can have greater confidence in their transactions, knowing that they are being protected from potential scams.
